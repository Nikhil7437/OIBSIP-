# Calculator. 
Welcome to my GitHub repository! In this project, I have completed the task for the Oasis web development internship, which is to create a calculator.

The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The calculator has a user-friendly interface that allows users to input numbers and perform calculations with ease. The user can clear the input fields, and the calculator also displays the result of the calculation in a clear and concise manner.

I have thoroughly tested the calculator to ensure that it functions correctly and accurately. The code is well-organized, documented, and follows best practices to ensure maintainability and scalability.

Overall, this project showcases my skills in web development and my ability to deliver high-quality work. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Thank you for visiting!
